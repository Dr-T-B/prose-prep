    prompt: "How does Dickens present the consequences of Gradgrind's utilitarian philosophy?",
    paragraph:
      "Dickens's critique of Gradgrindian education operates through a sustained assault on the senses: the schoolroom, described as 'a vault' in which children sit 'in ranks' awaiting the deposit of Facts, translates the human mind into a commodity processed by an industrial system. The metaphor of the vault is not incidental — it performs burial, suggesting that Gradgrind's pedagogy entombs feeling before it can breathe. Crucially, the novel refuses to contain this damage to the schoolroom alone. Louisa, the principal victim, carries the vault inside her; her famous stare into the factory furnace ('There seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke') enacts the extinguishing of imagination from within. Dickens argues, with increasing urgency, that what is destroyed in childhood is not recoverable — the utilitarian system does not merely suppress but amputates.",

      "Opens with a precise critical claim about method and consequence (AO1 + AO2).",
      "Short integrated quotation analysed for its metaphorical register, not just its surface meaning (AO2).",

    prompt: "How does McEwan use narrative perspective to explore the limits of fiction?",
    paragraph:
      "McEwan's decision to delay the revelation of Briony's authorship until the metafictional coda is itself a formal argument: the reader's complicity in accepting the novel's events as 'real' mirrors the problem the novel interrogates. In Part Three, Briony describes her writing as a 'crime' she has 'tried to expiate' — a legal-theological compound that refuses to separate artistic failure from moral failure. The free indirect discourse that permeates the novel, slipping between consciousness without announcement, performs its own version of the unreliable narrator: we do not know whose perception we inhabit until the moment our confidence is withdrawn. McEwan is interested, finally, not in guilt as feeling but in guilt as structure — the form of the novel is not a vehicle for the story but the condition of its possibility. A novelist who writes ending after ending cannot undo what was done; she can only testify to the irremediability of the original wound.",
    notes: [
      "Engages immediately with form as argument — treats narrative choice as meaning-making (AO2).",
      "Quotation unpacked at the level of connotation (legal + theological) rather than denotation (AO2).",
      "Moves from local technique (FID) to structural claim — sustained analytical arc (AO1).",
